First of all, I would like to note that to create this code, I used some sources to improve my own understanding of how certain modules work, such as wtforms and others. I used video tutorials on YouTube, various sites, as well as a course on oop on Udemy.
The essence of the code is to create a page that helps a person to add a product, customer and other necessary order information to the Megaventory system by interacting with the user through a simple but concise graphical interface.
As a basis, I used the flask framework, because it is quite simple, but at the same time, functional. 
Each group of objects is represented by a certain class, in which all the actions that can be performed with them are prescribed.
The Megaventory API is used to establish contact with the site, but this is where the problem arises. The code writes that adding a product was successful, but it is not. I'd be really grateful if you could help me understand where the problem is, as I'm sure it's a matter of one or two lines of code.
In any case, internships are all about constant learning and experience.
Also, to render the page itself, an HTML file is used, which contains all the "design" aspects and which you can also view.
